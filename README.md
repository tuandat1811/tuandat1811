# About me:
- 👋 Hi, I’m Hoang Dang Tuan Dat. Call me Dat if you like.
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-end Developer and UI/UX Design. If possible I also want to try Business Analyst and Tester.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Engineering at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. Currently I'm on my third years.
Also I am learning French and Japanese.
- 💞️ In my free times I want to chill out, have some coffee, play some games or just simply rest.
